#The Coiffure

'The Coiffure' by Mary Cassatt is a print representing a woman completing daily tasks infront of a mirror. This print was created during a time of fascination with Asian cultures and art styles. The print above shows inspiration taken from ukiyo-e prints as well as Edgar Degas and Gustave Caillebotte. With male artists dominating the art world at this time, many pictures of woman portrayed by men consisted of the inclusion of erotic undertones. The sexulization of woman in their daily lives. Mary Cassatt took this as inspiration and used her gender to paint similar concepts and relate to the nakedness of the working class woman. Her goal was to de-eroticise womans figure studies in art and rather showcase pieces the daily busy Parisian woman could relate to.
