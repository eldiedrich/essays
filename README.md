Mary Cassatt is known for her works representing women and their relationships with each other and themselves. With male artists dominating the art world at this time, many pictures of woman portrayed by men consisted of the inclusion of erotic undertones, the sexulization of woman in their daily lives. Mary Cassatt took this as inspiration and used her gender to paint similar concepts and relate to the nakedness of the working class woman. Her goal was to de-eroticise womans figure studies in art and rather showcase pieces the daily busy Parisian woman could relate to. This essay goes over Marry's impact on society through her prints, as well as how the historical context impacted her work.

#The Coiffure

'The Coiffure' (1891) by Mary Cassat is a print mimicing the technique of Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock, specifically the work of Kitagawa Utamaro. With the opening of Japans border in 1854, many artists including Cassatt became fascinated with this newly available art style. Western artists were still exploring woodblock techniques, trying to figure out how Japanese artists were able to create such flat colored prints. We can see Cassatts experimentation in this final rendition.Thin contour lines were created by etching on a metal sheet, likely copper. Ink then smoothed into the etched placement and snamped onto paper. The Chicago Art Institue states this piece was made with three different plates, which is why we are able to see overlaping contour lines and patterns. After taking a closer look it appears that the print was filled in my hand as we can see spaces where pigments collied and extend beyond the intended lines.

'The Coiffure' takes inspiration from 'Takashima Ohisa Using Two Mirrors to Observe Her Coiffure' by Kitagawa Utamaro. In many of Cassat's prints, including this one, she appropriates Utamaros work. Cassatt expirements with Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblack print, often copying Utamaro's figures poses, and embeddes western woman into her work making it more personable to Europeans. 

Both works depict a woman getting ready infront of her mirror. In Cassatt's work she is focusing on the task of doing her hair while she sits on striped lounge chair. Above her torso is exposed, but below is corvered by a plain cloth, likely a sheet. The subjects displays little depth as there is minimal crosshatching nor variation in pigment.
